# NEWS READER
1. Project Idea: News Reader

Why I Chose This Idea:

The “News Reader” project has been selected because I want to create an application that allows a user to read articles from different news sources. As the user has full control with the categories, topics and even languages of updated news, this app can be personalized. However, it can also be useful for gaining practical experience in the use of third party APIs, real time data, and fun front-end wizardry.

2. API: NewsAPI


API Overview:

In this case, I shall be using NewsAPI which is a smart API that connects you to articles and headlines from thousands of news channels across the globe. NewsAPI is easy to work with and provides the opportunity to search for articles by keywords, category, source, and language. The key features of this API are:
Top Headlines:Get the latest headlines from around the world, or sort them by country, topic, or source.
Everything: Use articles that bear certain search words, published within a certain duration of time and in a given language.
Sources: Interact with a list of news sources from which you can select at request top stories or an article.


Through this API, I will be able to provide the users with the relevant news articles in real-time; the users will be able to filter news stories based on the content.
